            Although Hyper Audience makes good faith efforts to provide Individuals with access to their Personal
            Information, there may be circumstances in which Hyper Audience is unable to provide access, including but
            not limited to: where the information contains legal privilege, would compromise others’ privacy or other
            legitimate rights, where the burden or expense of providing access would be disproportionate to the risks to
            the Individual’s privacy in the case in question or where it is commercially proprietary. If Hyper Audience
            determines that access should be restricted in any particular instance, we will provide you with an
            explanation of why that determination has been made and a contact point for any further inquiries.
